## Helloooo

This project is an anonymous real-time collaboration tool designed to allow users to create and join shared workspaces without requiring authentication or account creation. A user can create a collaboration room by entering a custom name, and the system generates a unique shareable link. Others can join instantly through the link and participate in real-time collaboration.

The tool leverages Node.js and WebSocket technology to provide seamless real-time synchronization across multiple clients. It focuses on simplicity and usability: no sign-ups, no passwordsâ€”just instant access.

The main use cases include:

- Quick brainstorming sessions

- Temporary collaboration in meetings

- Lightweight teamwork without administrative overhead

- Real-time note-taking or shared editing

The project will be developed with agile practices in mind, simulating enterprise workflows (sprints, stories, and tasks). It will include a front-end interface for creating/joining rooms, a back-end server for room and session management, and support for real-time updates.

Future enhancements may include optional persistence, role management, and integrations with third-party services.
